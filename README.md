EurKEY-Mac
==========

The Keyboard Layout for Europeans, Coders and Translators - Version for Mac OS X.

This is a port of the [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) 
with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts.
