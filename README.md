EurKEY-Mac
==========

The Keyboard Layout for Europeans, Coders and Translators - Version for Mac OS X.

This is a port of the [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) 
with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts.

**Status**: The whole layout should be mapped now. Please report if you find any missing characters.


Install
=======

Copy the two files `EurKEY.keylayout` and `EurKEY.icns` to your library,
either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library`).
